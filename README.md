# Biped-Robot-Prototype

![NTNU_logo](assets/NTNU_logo.png)

This is the reposatory for our Bachelor's thesis. It will be updated continously the next months :lying_face:... or at least as often as we manage. The project has a deadline in May, that will also be the deadline to finish the git. Up until then this reposatory may or may not be a complete mess.

Anyways this project is about a thin and simple robot that can't walk. We will teach it to walk. How? Through C++ and ROS. Each part of the robot will have it's own floder where we explain the code associated with that part.
