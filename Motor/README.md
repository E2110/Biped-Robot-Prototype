# Motor

The motor used in the embedded system of the robot are the Maxon 14887 DC motor which has the capability to output 150W, the motor is connected to a gearbox which gears the motor 1-to-6. The motor is controlled with the help of an ESCON 70/10 servocontroller. This servocontroller needs a PWM signal as input, where the duty cycle determines the current output of the motor. The servo controller also has input pins for the determination of the output direction of the motor.
